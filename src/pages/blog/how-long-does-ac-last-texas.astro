					If you live in Texas, your air conditioner isn't a luxury—it's a survival tool. From May through October, our AC systems work overtime to keep our homes comfortable. But this constant demand takes a toll. So how long can you expect your AC to last in the Texas heat? Here's what Bastrop County homeowners need to know.
				</p>

				<h2>Average AC Lifespan in Texas vs. Other States</h2>
				<p>
					The national average lifespan for a central air conditioning system is 15-20 years. However, in Texas, that number is typically lower:
				</p>

				<div class="highlight-box">
					<h3>AC Lifespan by Region</h3>
					<ul class="comparison-list">
						<li><strong>Northern States:</strong> 18-25 years</li>
						<li><strong>Moderate Climates:</strong> 15-20 years</li>
						<li><strong>Texas & Southern States:</strong> 10-15 years</li>
						<li><strong>Coastal Texas (with salt air):</strong> 8-12 years</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>
					Why the difference? It comes down to runtime. An AC in Minnesota might run 600-800 hours per year. Here in Bastrop County, your AC can easily run 2,000-3,000 hours annually. That's 3-4 times more wear and tear.
				</p>

				<h2>Why Texas is Hard on Air Conditioners</h2>
				<p>
					Our Central Texas climate creates unique challenges for HVAC systems:
				</p>

				<h3>Extreme Heat</h3>
				<p>
					When outdoor temperatures hit 100°F or higher—which happens regularly from June through September—your AC works at maximum capacity for extended periods. This stresses the compressor, which is the most expensive component to replace.
				</p>

				<h3>Long Cooling Season</h3>
				<p>
					In Bastrop County, we typically need AC from late March through early November—that's nearly 8 months of cooling. Many northern homeowners only run AC for 3-4 months.
				</p>

				<h3>Humidity</h3>
				<p>
					Our humidity makes your AC work harder. The system must remove moisture from the air while also cooling it, which increases runtime and wear.
				</p>

				<h3>Dust and Debris</h3>
				<p>
					Texas dust, cedar pollen, and agricultural debris can clog filters, coat coils, and reduce efficiency. Rural properties around Rosanky, Paige, and Smithville may face even more debris challenges.
				</p>

				<h3>Storm Damage</h3>
				<p>
					Texas thunderstorms, hail, and power surges can damage outdoor units and electrical components. Even minor damage can shorten your system's lifespan.
				</p>

				<h2>Signs Your AC is Nearing End of Life</h2>
				<p>
					Watch for these warning signs that your air conditioner may be ready for replacement:
				</p>

				<h3>Age</h3>
				<p>
					If your AC is 10+ years old in Texas, it's entering its final years. Start planning for replacement, even if it's still running.
				</p>

				<h3>Frequent Repairs</h3>
				<p>
					Multiple repairs in a single year often signal systemic failure. If you're spending $500+ annually on repairs, that money might be better invested in a new system.
				</p>

				<h3>Rising Energy Bills</h3>
				<p>
					An aging AC loses efficiency. If your summer electric bills keep climbing despite similar usage, your system is working harder for less cooling.
				</p>

				<h3>Inconsistent Cooling</h3>
				<p>
					Hot spots, rooms that won't cool, or temperature swings indicate your system can't keep up with demand.
				</p>

				<h3>Strange Noises</h3>
				<p>
					Grinding, squealing, or banging sounds suggest worn parts. Some repairs make sense, but in an older system, these noises often herald more failures to come.
				</p>

				<h3>R-22 Refrigerant</h3>
				<p>
					If your system uses R-22 (Freon), it's time to plan for replacement. R-22 was phased out in 2020, making repairs increasingly expensive as supplies dwindle.
				</p>

				<h2>Factors That Affect Your AC's Lifespan</h2>
				<p>
					Not all AC systems age the same way. Here's what influences how long yours will last:
				</p>

				<h3>Installation Quality</h3>
				<p>
					A properly installed system lasts years longer than a poorly installed one. Key factors include correct sizing, proper refrigerant charge, good airflow, and quality ductwork connections.
				</p>

				<h3>Maintenance History</h3>
				<p>
					Regular maintenance is the single biggest factor in AC longevity. Systems that receive annual tune-ups consistently outlast neglected ones by 3-5 years.
				</p>

				<h3>Filter Changes</h3>
				<p>
					Something as simple as changing your filter monthly can add years to your system's life by preventing restricted airflow damage.
				</p>

				<h3>Equipment Quality</h3>
				<p>
					Premium brands with better components typically last longer than budget equipment. The difference often shows up after year 8-10.
				</p>

				<h3>Thermostat Settings</h3>
				<p>
					Reasonable temperature settings reduce runtime. Setting your thermostat to 78°F instead of 72°F can significantly reduce wear on your system.
				</p>

				<h3>Home Efficiency</h3>
				<p>
					Good insulation, sealed ductwork, and energy-efficient windows reduce how hard your AC must work, extending its lifespan.
				</p>

				<h2>How to Extend Your AC's Life in Texas</h2>
				<p>
					Even in our harsh climate, you can maximize your system's lifespan:
				</p>

				<h3>1. Schedule Annual Maintenance</h3>
				<p>
					Professional tune-ups catch problems early, clean critical components, and optimize efficiency. Spring is ideal—before the summer rush.
				</p>

				<h3>2. Change Filters Monthly</h3>
				<p>
					During peak season, check your filter every 2-3 weeks. Replace it when visibly dirty, which in Texas is usually monthly.
				</p>

				<h3>3. Keep the Outdoor Unit Clear</h3>
				<p>
					Maintain 2 feet of clearance around your condenser. Remove debris, trim vegetation, and rinse the coils gently with a garden hose annually.
				</p>

				<h3>4. Use a Programmable Thermostat</h3>
				<p>
					Smart temperature management reduces unnecessary runtime. Raise the temperature when you're away and let it cool down before you return.
				</p>

				<h3>5. Seal and Insulate Ductwork</h3>
				<p>
					Leaky ducts in a hot Texas attic can waste 30% of your cooled air, forcing your AC to work much harder.
				</p>

				<h3>6. Provide Shade for the Outdoor Unit</h3>
				<p>
					A shaded condenser runs more efficiently. Plant shrubs (maintaining clearance) or install an awning that doesn't restrict airflow.
				</p>

				<h3>7. Address Problems Quickly</h3>
				<p>
					Small issues become big problems. If you notice reduced cooling, strange sounds, or anything unusual, get it checked before damage spreads.
				</p>

				<h2>When to Replace vs. Repair</h2>
				<p>
					Use the "5,000 Rule" as a guideline: Multiply the repair cost by the age of your system. If the result exceeds $5,000, replacement usually makes more sense.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>$500 repair × 8-year-old system = $4,000 → Repair is reasonable</li>
					<li>$500 repair × 12-year-old system = $6,000 → Consider replacement</li>
					<li>$1,500 repair × 10-year-old system = $15,000 → Replace</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Also consider efficiency gains. A new 16 SEER system replacing an old 10 SEER unit can reduce cooling costs by 40%, offsetting the investment over time.
				</p>
